In this project, we have aimed to analyze the impact of real-world events and news headlines on the stock market. Having used data scraped from multiple sources for our analysis, we understood how to effectively clean and integrate the data and then store it in the SQL database. Using SSIS we performed the ETL and learnt the various SSIS tools available in Visual Studio. Later we generated reports and visualizations in SSRS and R, to gather insights from the data, as per the business requirements. 


We created the relevant XML and Schema. Also, we explored Neo4j graph databases and understood the advantages of graph databases. 
Moving on, this project can be further expanded to store data in real time and generate predictions  regarding stock prices accordingly.
